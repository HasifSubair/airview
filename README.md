# Air View

### Introduction

Air View is created for analyzing the flight delays across the United States. Air View will intially ingest flights data,
airport and aircraft information. The datasets are combined and stored in a denormalized format as parquet files.

The dataset can be later combined with weather and aircraft repair data to predict aircraft repair cycles.
